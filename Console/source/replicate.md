## Create RNodes
This section contains the tools and guides necessary to create more RNodes. Creating any number of RNodes is **completely free and unrestricted** for all personal, non-commercial and humanitarian purposes. If doing so provides value to you or your community, you are encouraged to [contribute](./contribute.html) whatever you find to be reasonable.

In addition, you are very much **encouraged** to create RNodes for sale or commercial purposes, and doing so requires buying a copy of the RNode Firmware for each unit produced for commercial purposes. Please read the [selling RNodes]({ASSET_PATH}sell_rnodes.html) section for more details.

### Getting Started
To create your own RNodes, there are generally three distinct paths you can take:

- The first, and easiest option, is to [create a basic RNode]({ASSET_PATH}guides/install_firmware.html) from one of the supported development boards. This option allows you to simply acquire a board from any online or local vendor that sells them, and then use the `rnodeconf` program to automatically turn it into an RNode. Such an RNode will be functionally equivalent to the other options, but might lack some niceties.
- The second option is to use one of the [RNode Build Recipes]({ASSET_PATH}recipes.html) included here. These recipes contain all the resources needed to build a specific type of RNode, such as a handheld device, or an outdoor-mountable, solar-powered access point.
- The third option is to [create your own RNode design]({ASSET_PATH}guides/make_rnodes.html) from scratch. This offers unlimited flexibility, but is a bit more involved.

If you already have some experience with 3D-printing and electronics projects, the recommended path is to pick a [build recipe]({ASSET_PATH}recipes.html) for the RNode type you want. That way, you will get a neat and portable unit that's ready for real-world use.

If you are just getting started, it might be nice to get a working "proof-of-concept" with minimal effort first, though. In such a case, [creating a basic RNode]({ASSET_PATH}guides/install_firmware.html) is a good starting point.
