**Hello!** I am the creator of the RNode ecosystem.

If you have any general questions or comments about any of the projects I maintain, I encourage you to post it in one of the following places:

- The [discussion forum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/discussions) on GitHub
- The [Reticulum Matrix Channel](#reticulum:matrix.org) at `#reticulum:matrix.org`
- The [Reticulum subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/reticulum)

To get in touch with me personally, you can use one of the following methods, in order of preference:

- LXMF at `8dd57a738226809646089335a6b03695`
- Matrix using `@unsignedmark:matrix.org`
- Email by using the address mark at unsigned dot io
 
Please use the public forums and channels for support and help requests. I receive a lot of messages, and while I try to answer everyone (eventually), this is not always possible.
